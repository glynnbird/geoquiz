# usstatesquiz

A simple web app that renders a quiz where the contestant has to name all 50 states of the US. As the answers are typed, the shapes of the states are presented on a Leaflet map.

The data comes from [https://github.com/glynnbird/usstatesgeojson](https://github.com/glynnbird/usstatesgeojson), with the data being stored in a Cloudant database.
